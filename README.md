# Design System for AI

This project is a research initiative exploring the creation of applications using a design system optimized for AI.

## Goal

To explore and test methodologies for creating front-end applications where AI systems can efficiently consume and interpret design guidelines and code.

## Structure

The `design-system/` folder contains design system and live documentation:
- Design guidelines
- Front-end code patterns
- Components and their specifications

The `apps/` folder contains AI-generated applications based on the design system

## Concept

The design system serves as a source of truth for AI, enabling applications to be developed consistently and following established standards through automatic interpretation of the guidelines.
